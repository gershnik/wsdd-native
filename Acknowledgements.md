# Acknowledgements

wsddn makes use of the open source software listed below.

In addition, wsddn was directly influenced by [wsdd](https://github.com/christgau/wsdd). While no source code from it was directly re-used in this project, many design and implementation ideas were; as well as command line design and some documentation content. Hence it is listed among libraries below.
